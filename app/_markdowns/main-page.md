abstract: "Personal construct theory (applied via the repertory grid technique) supports interpretivist research in a structured manner and, as such, has relevance for researchers conducting studies focused on the human and organisational aspects of software engineering. Personal construct theory (which underpins the rep- ertory grid technique) is introduced, and the technique and its administration is discussed. Research studies from the literature are reviewed to provide illustrative examples of its application within a soft- ware engineering context. Since any research approach needs to answer questions about its reliability and validity within a particular study, these issues are considered for repertory grid investigations and criteria are offered that can be used to judge these issues within a planned, and/or reported, study."
